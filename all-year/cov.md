# Coefficient of Variance

Coefficient of variance \(COV\), defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean for each water year, is calculated individually for each water year. The output metrics for COV flow will consist of three values \(10th, 50th, and 90th percentile\), representing the range of outputs among all water years.
