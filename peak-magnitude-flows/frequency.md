# Peak Magnitude Flows - Frequency

####

#### Definition:

Peak flow frequency is peak magnitude flow component that calculates the number of times that flow crosses over the flow threshold during a water year for the \(2nd, 5th, 10th, and 20th percentile\) exceedance flows over the period of record.

#### Steps:

1. Convert raw data of from a single column of dates and a single column of flows into a matrix with columns organized by water year. Each column starts with the beginning of the water year \(i.e. 10/1\) and ends with the end of water year \(9/30\).
2. Calculate the 2nd, 5th, 10th, and 20th percentile exceedance flow values over the entire period of record \(i.e., the entire flow matrix\).
  ```py
  for i in exceedance_percent:
        exceedance_value[i] = np.nanpercentile(matrix, 100 - i)
  ```
3. In each water year, create an object each time the flow passes the exceedance value, and append that object onto an array.
  ```py
  """Init current flow object"""
        for percent in exceedance_percent:
            exceedance_object[percent] = []
            exceedance_duration[percent] = []
            current_flow_object[percent] = None

        """Loop through each flow value for the year to check if they pass exceedance threshold"""
        for row_number, flow_row in enumerate(matrix[:, column_number]):

            for percent in exceedance_percent:
                if bool(flow_row < exceedance_value[percent] and current_flow_object[percent]) or bool(row_number == len(matrix[:, column_number]) - 1 and current_flow_object[percent]):
                    """End of an object if it falls below threshold, or end of column"""
                    current_flow_object[percent].end_date = row_number + 1
                    current_flow_object[percent].get_max_magnitude()
                    exceedance_duration[percent].append(current_flow_object[percent].duration)
                    current_flow_object[percent] = None
  ```
4. Calculate the frequency by counting the length of the object array.
  ```py
  for percent in exceedance_percent:
      freq[percent].append(len(exceedance_object[percent]))
  ```
