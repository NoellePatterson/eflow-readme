### Wet Season Initiation Flow

The wet season initiation flow describes a peak in the annual hydrograph created by the first significant increase in flow following the dry season low flow. The wet season initiation event is the first date between October 1st to December 15th in which flow exceeds the initiation event threshold, which is defined as twice the magnitude of the previous dry seasonâ€™s base flow or 1 cfs, whichever is greater. This initiation event often takes the form of a storm event that introduces a pulse of flow into the stream. It typically occurs each year but may not occur in some years depending on climate conditions. The metrics calculated for wet season initiation flow include the timing, magnitude, and duration of the wet season initiation event.
