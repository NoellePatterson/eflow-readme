### Wet Season Initiation Flows {#wet-season-initiation-flows}

The wet season initiation flow describes a peak in the annual hydrograph created by the first significant increase in flow following the dry season baseflow. This initiation event often takes the form of a storm event that introduces a pulse of flow into the stream. It typically occurs each year but may not in some years depending on climate conditions.The metrics calculated for wet season initiation include the timing, magnitude, and duration of the wet season initiation event.
