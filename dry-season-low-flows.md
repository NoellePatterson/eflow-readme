# Dry Season Low Flows

The dry season low flows include the following suite of metrics:

1. Dry season start timing
2. Dry season baseflow magnitude
3. Dry season baseflow duration
4. Number of days with 0 cfs flow during the summer baseflow period

Each metric is calculated individually for each water year of the input data. For example, if the input flow data has 26 water years of data, each of the above metrics will be internally calculated 26 times.
