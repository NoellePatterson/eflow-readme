# Peak Magnitude Flows

The following metrics are calculated for high flows that exceed the 2nd, 5th, 10th, and 20th percentile flows across the  period of record:

* Magnitude 
* Timing
* Duration
* Frequency

For example, the 2nd percentile flow is the magnitude of flow that is only exceeded 2% of the time over the period of record \(conversely, it is higher than 98% of flows over the period of record\). High flows may exceed the percentile thresholds multiple times in one water year, or not at all in other water years. The final reported value is the median value from each annual array of exceedance characteristics \(including magnitude, timing, duration and frequency\). The four exceedance flows percentages, multiplied by the four metrics categories, results in 16 peak magnitude flow metrics calculated for each water year.
