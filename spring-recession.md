# Spring Recession

The spring recession marks the seasonal shift from high magnitude winter flows to the  dry season baseflow. A continuous decline in flows is expected during this period until the beginning of the summer baseflow is reached. The metrics used to characterize the spring recession are magnitude and timing on the first day of the recession, duration of the spring recession period, and rate of change of flow across the period.
