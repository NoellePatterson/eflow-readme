# Metrics

The FFC calculates metrics describing ecologically relevant components of the annual streamflow hydrograph. The metrics are organized into four seasonally-based functional flow components, in addition to two summary metrics \(average annual flow and coefficient of variation\) calculated for each water year. The FFC metrics are listed below.

#### Peak Magnitude Flows

Each of the following metrics is calculated annually for high flows that exceed the 2nd, 5th, 10th, and 20th percentile flows across the period of record. For example, the 2nd percentile flow is the magnitude of flow that is only exceeded 2% of the time over the period of record \(conversely, it is higher than 98% of flows over the period of record\). The four exceedance flows percentages, multiplied by the four metrics categories, results in 16 peak magnitude flow metrics calculated for each water year.

Metrics based on the 2nd, 5th, 10th, and 20th percentile flows over the period of record:

* Magnitude
* Timing
* Duration
* Frequency

Other peak magnitude flows season metrics:

* Wet season baseflow magnitude
* Wet season start timing

#### Spring Recession Flows

* Magnitude
* Timing
* Duration
* Rate of change

#### Dry Season Low Flows

* Magnitude
* Timing
* Duration from start of dry season low flows until the start of the wet season of the next water year
* Number of zero-flow days during the dry season period

#### Wet Season Initiation Flows

* Initiation event magnitude
* Initiation event timing
* Initiation event duration

#### All Year

* Coefficient of variance
* Average annual flow
