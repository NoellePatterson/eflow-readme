# Metrics

The FFC calculates metrics describing ecologically relevant components of the annual streamflow hydrograph. The metrics are organized into four seasonally-based functional flow components, in addition to two summary metrics \(average annual flow and coefficient of variation\) calculated for each water year. The FFC metrics are listed below.

#### Peak Magnitude Flows

Each of the following metrics is calculated annually for high flows that exceed the 2nd, 5th, 10th, and 20th percentile flows across the period of record:

* Magnitude
* Timing
* Duration
* Frequency

Other peak magnitude flow season metrics:

* Wet season baseflow magnitude
* Wet season start timing

#### Spring Recession Flows

* Magnitude
* Timing
* Duration
* Rate of change

#### Dry Season Low Flows

* Magnitude
* Timing
* Duration from start of dry season low flows until the start of the wet season of the next water year
* Number of zero-flow days during the dry season period

#### Wet Season Initiation Flows

* Initiation event magnitude
* Initiation event timing
* Initiation event duration

#### All Year

* Coefficient of variance
* Average annual flow
