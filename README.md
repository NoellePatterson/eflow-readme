# Functional Flow Calculator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leogoesger/func-flow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leogoesger/func-flow)

## About

The functional flows calculator \(FFC\) quantifies key aspects of the annual flow regime based on long-term daily streamflow time series data, producing a broad suite of descriptive functional flow metrics. These metrics are meant to characterize ecologically relevant components of any flow regime in a robust, objective manner to enable comparisons of streamflow across regions, natural stream classes, and various forms and magnitudes of flow alteration. The FFC generates metrics describing aspects of streamflow timing, magnitude, duration, frequency, and rate of change, organized into four seasonally-based functional flow components: 1\) wet season initiation flows, 2\) peak magnitude flows, 3\) spring recession flows, and 4\) dry season low flows.

This project uses [Python3](https://www.python.org/) for its processing algorithm, [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), and [D3](https://d3js.org/) for front end web development, and [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/), and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the server.
