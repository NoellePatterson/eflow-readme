# Wet Season Initiation Flow - Magnitude

#### Definition

The wet season initiation event magnitude is set as the magnitude of flow on the date of the initiation event. This represents the  flow on the date of the initiation event, which is the peak flow. For more information on the initiation event timing metric, which drives the initiation event magnitude, see the section on wet season initiation timing. This metric is in units of cfs. 

#### Steps

1. Determine the timing of the wet season initiation event. See the subsection on Wet Season Initiation Timing for steps to calculate the timing of the wet season initiation.

2. Assign the magnitude of the wet season initiation flow as the flow on the start date of the spring recession.
  ```py
  elif (spl(flow_index[0] - half_duration) - min_flow) / (flow_index[1] - min_flow) < flush_threshold_perc and (spl(flow_index[0] + half_duration) - min_flow) / (flow_index[1] - min_flow) < flush_threshold_perc and flow_index[1] > broad_filter_data[int(flow_index[0])] and flow_index[1] > min_flush_magnitude and flow_index[0] <= date_cutoff:
                """both side of flow value at the peak + half duration index fall below flush_threshold_perc"""
                start_dates[-1]=int(flow_index[0])
                mags[-1]=flow_index[1]
  ```
