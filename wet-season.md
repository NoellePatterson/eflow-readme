### Wet Season

The following two metrics, wet season timing and wet season baseflow magnitude, characterize the overall wet season of the water year, and complement the high flow metrics calculated as part of the peak magnitude flows seasonal component. This flow component is separate from the wet season initiation flow component, which characterizes the single flow event that initiates the wet season.
